# Local Development 

## Setup Jekyll

- [Follow the instruction to set up Jekyll on your machine](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

## Building Locally

- Run `jekyll build` to build the project

## Running Locally

# Build Tool

GitHub Actions is set up to build and run tests from Pull Requests so that we can ensure the project builds and tests pass from nay changes made within branches before they are merged in. 

GitHub Actions is also used to deploy on merge into master.
