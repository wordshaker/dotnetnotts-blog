# Writing Cross Platform Games with MonoGame and .NET

Writing games is fun. Writing games also makes you think in a different way to web development, or the development of enterprise software. Even though we have game engines like [Unity](https://unity.com/solutions/game), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), and [Defold](https://defold.com/); as a C# and .NET Developer, it is sometimes fun to go a little lower level and write the engine yourself.

In this talk, I will show you how the MonoGame framework works, and how your application is structured differently to what you might expect in web development. I will also introduce you to a small 2D game engine I have developed called ExoGame2D that sits on top of MonoGame.

I will cover the following topics:

- The premise of a game loop
- Separating rendering from the game logic
- Using the MonoGame asset pipeline
- Creating a scene graph
- Rendering sprites and animated sprites
- Font rendering
- Bounding volume and pixel-perfect collision detection
- Game state management
- Rendering user-interface controls
- Game engine messaging systems
- Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad controllers

Game development is all about having fun, and using a simple game engine allows you to experiment with ideas quickly and efficiently.
